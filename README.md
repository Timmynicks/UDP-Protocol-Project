# UDP-Protocol-Project 
A program that makes a request with a private server to initialize a UDP protocol to retreive a series of packets in a random order for a text file.

The file is then checked for errors with a checksum before saved within the directory.

# Note
This program only works with Unix operating systems because it uses headers that only Unix provides.

Due to the use of a private server, the program cannot be run freely.
